# TextEditor
Java Spring MVC hibernate text editor

What this app does:


- Includes database connectivity
- Allows a user to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on category data
- Uses a database
- Serves static assets, such  fonts, CSS, and JS
- Edits text and stores the result 

** Need to fix testing.
Dont have experience for testing Hibernate DAO using JUnit.
